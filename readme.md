# My solution for Advent of code 2022

## Structure of the repository

Each folder contain both inputs and problems of the day.  
Example input is localed in `small_input.txt`, and the actual input of the problem is localted in `input.txt`.  
The programming language used in each day is decided by my mood.

## Language used so far

- Python (day 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9)
- Haskell (day 2, 6)
- C (day 4)

## Source of problems
